# **Algorithmic Art**
Art that is generated using principles of math, 
and tools from computer science. This art is 
often time-evolving and dynamic, or may be a 
static image which is the result of an algorithmic 
design. 

# Nature
## Fractal Fire
Generate fractal patterns with cellular automata that evolve from initial states 
like a solid square or a rectange(```python fractal_fire.py -coal ```). The location of this solid will greatly shape
the pattern created. 

For Example take the ``python fractal_fire.py -log`` command's output. Initially it
builds this state:

Which will eventually turn into:
![blazing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylersDurden/AlgorithmicArt/master/Nature/images/pattern.png)

## Gravity 
Accumulate celestial bodies in space over time with diffusion limited aggregation.

## Waves
This simulates hundreds of autonomous fireflies flying around. 

# Cellular

## Mazing 
Starting from an initially random state, the program attempts to build a maze like structure. 
Running ```python mazing.py``` will run through a series of increasingly sparser initially states
of randomly distributed points.
