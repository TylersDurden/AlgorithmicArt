# **Algorithmic Art**
Art that is generated using principles of math, 
and tools from computer science. This art is 
often time-evolving and dynamic, or may be a 
static image which is the result of an algorithmic 
design. 

# Nature
## Fractal Fire
Generate fractal patterns with cellular automata that evolve from initial states 
like a solid square or a rectange(```python fractal_fire.py -coal ```). The location of this solid will greatly shape
the pattern created. 

For Example take the ``python fractal_fire.py -log`` command's output. Initially it
builds this state:

Which will eventually turn into:

## Gravity 
Accumulate celestial bodies in space over time with diffusion limited aggregation.

## Waves
This simulates hundreds of autonomous fireflies flying around. 

# Cellular

## Mazing 
Starting from an initially random state, the program attempts to build a maze like structure. 
Running ```python mazing.py``` will run through a series of increasingly sparser initially states
of randomly distributed points.

Eventually the sparsity becomes so great the crawling maze kernel can't actually reach the entirety of
the seed state. These are probably the more fascinating simulations to observe.

Even more frenzied are the initial seeds that are **mostly empty**. This ensures that no mazes can really be built,
so instead pockets of somewhat orderly grid structures are built out of fragmented sections on a chaotic bit plane.
